Hi there 👋. My name is Zhuofeng Li. I'm a CS Ph.D. student at [Texas A&M University][0], advised by Prof. [Yu Zhang][1]. I am also a visiting student at [Stanford University][6] working with Prof. [Yejin Choi][2] and Prof. [James Zou][3]. Previously, I interned [TIGER-Lab][14] at University of Waterloo working with Prof. [Wenhu Chen][5].

My research lies in LLM/VLM-post training, including reasoning, alignment, evaluation, and applications. Recently, I am particularly focus on agentic reinforcement learning. As part of this direction, I as the core contributor build [VerlTool](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool) (500+ stars), a unified and extensible framework for tool-agent RL training.

I am actively seeking research collaborations and intern opportunities in LLM/VLM post-training, reinforcement learning, agents, and other exciting directions.

Feel free to reach out me through zhuofengli12345@gmail.com

🚨 **Paper Alert!**
Thrilled to introduce **AgentFlow** — a **trainable**, **tool-integrated agentic framework** that **directly optimizes agents within the system in an online fashion** using **Flow-GRPO** 🌀💫, achieving **superior tool use** 🛠 and **long-horizon reasoning** 🧠 across diverse domains.
